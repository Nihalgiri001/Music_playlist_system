This is a music playlist application created on Embarcadero Dev C++ as a course based project for the completion of Data structures course, it implements concepts such as Linked Lists, queue's, stack's to simulate a music playlist application.
Make a note that for the application to work, the songs or the audio files that you wish to play must be present in the same folder as where the code is present, and make sure that the files are .wav files
